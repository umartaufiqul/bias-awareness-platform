    "This jupyter notebook describes the overall process of the assignment, including (1) detailed explanations about the motivation scenario along with codes and (2) skeleton codes that you are required to fill in. Two deliverables need to be submitted: this jupyter notebook and the discussion. You do not need to explicitly submit this jupyter notebook as our server keeps track of it. Make sure you submit the discussion on KLMS.\n",

    "In this assignment, students are required to implement the following three functions. We are going to provide a specific algorithm for you to implement so that the task is not open-ended but concrete enough. Specific precondition and postcondition of the functions are going to be explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `getBiasScore(predictionResultTable)` : Given a prediction result that describes whether tweets are abusive depending on tweets' dialects, returns a numerical score representing the bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `undersampleData(trainingData, dialectClassifier, dialectLabel, ratio)` : Returns a dataset that undersampling has been performed. In other words, randomly select `ratio` portion of samples of tweets written in the dialect `dialectLabel` on the dataset `trainingData`. The tweets written in other dialect should remain as the original dataset. `languageClassifier` is used for predicting a dialect of tweets, which is going to be explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `processPredictionResult(predictionResult, majorLabel, minorLabel, theta)` : returns a processed prediction result in a way that it mitigates the bias. Conceptually, we are going to apply different thresholds across labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the objective of this assignment is not to optimize the score of bias but to experiment your own ideas around data analysis and bias mitigation, although we explicitly ask you to implement functions for the sake of assignment. Therefore, It is completely okay to revise the existing codes, and even it is highly encouraged to try things out across multiple stages of machine learning pipeline to mitigate bias. Please explore as much as you can, and write the exploration on the discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the dataset and overall process of this assignment has been borrowed from a set of references and tuned to present more evident results on educational purpose. Although we are dealing with the real data and existing techniques, results in this assignment do not represent the real world: we cannot directly generalize our observations in this assignment. Please focus on methodological aspects of dealing with bias. You may want to discuss limitations of the overall process of this assignment as well."

To vectorize text, we are going to use [TF-IDF]() with [n-grams]() (1 $\\leq$ n $\\leq$ 3)."

    "\n",
    "Now we have a trained model, which can be used for moderating tweets. Let's check whether the model is biased with respect to dialects, African-American English and Standard American English. Here, the meaning of \"our model is biased\" means that __our model prediction gives different distribution across the dialects. (needs comment from you guys: do you think it is reasonable?)__. For example, if our model tends to predict a large portion of tweets in AAE as abusive whereas a large portion of tweets in SAE as neither, then we can say our model is biased (assuming the data collection method of tweet does not have any bias between AAE and SAE). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to use the trained model to classify a totally new tweet dataset. The data contains a label that represents the dialect. Note that we do not have the ground truth label on the tweet's abusiveness, because we don't actually know the ground truth of a tweet which we are going to apply our model. Therefore, we cannot measure any model performance (i.e. precision, recall, f1-score) with this new dataset, but we can only check the bias."

    "\n",
    "Given the column `class` (that represents the tweet is written in AAE or SAE) and the column `predLabel` (that represents whether the tweet is abusive), we can measure whether model's prediction is biased. There can be multiple ways to compute such bias, and each measure might captures different perspectives on the bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simple measures of bias is to compare the ratio of predicted labels. In other words, we can compute how much percent each predicted label account for between AAE class and SAE class, and compare the values. For example, let's say our model predicted 1000 AAE tweets and 300 of them were predicted as 'offensive'. The the 'offensive' label account for 30% of the entire prediction (let's say $P(t = 1|AAE) = 0.35$). We do the same calculating for SAE tweets, and we got 100 'offensive' tweets (let's say $P(t = 1|SAE) = 0.12$). In this case, we can say the model is likely to predict AAE tweets more offensive than SAE tweets. Let's see how it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the following function `getBiasScore(predictionResultTable` that computes the ratio between the portion of a label in AAE and that of SAE. i.e. <font size=\"5\"> $\\frac{ P(t=c_i|AAE) }{P(t=c_i|SAE)}$ </font> where $t$ refers to tweets and $c_i$ refers to a label representing abusiveness. Then we can get a value for each label."

    "You can see that the distribution of AAE is highly skewed to the label 'offensive' compared to that of SAE. One of the potential reasons might be that our training dataset is biased. In other words, it could be possible that the training data contains much more AAE tweets with 'offensive' label compared to other labels ('hateful', 'neither').\n",

    "`dialectPrediction.predict(str.split())` returns four values each of which refers to a probability of being a single dialect, which are African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and White, respectively. We are going to classify a tweet as AAE if the probability of being AA is greater than or equal to $0.5$. Simiarly, we classify a tweet as SAE if that of being White is greater than or equal to $0.5$. Please note that a similar approach of predicting dialects has been taken by [this research]().\n",

    "### 7-2. Reject Option based Classification [cite]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we are going to implement Reject Option based Classification [cite], which is another technique of mitigating bias. This technique can be applied when model produces probabilities for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we trained a model, and use it to predict the abusive label of a tweet $t$. Then the model produces a probability for each label $l_i$, meaning the probability of being assigned to the label $l_i$ for the tweet $t$. Normally, we find the maximum probability across the labels and assign the label as a prediction result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insight of this bias mitigation technique is that even if we assign the label with the highest probability, it can be still uncertain. For example, let's say we have two labels $l_1$ and $l_2$, and our model produces probabilities $p_1$=0.55 and $p_2$=0.45 for a tweet $t$. Even if we can assign the label $l_1$ in this case, we can say the model is not really sure about the assignment because the probability (i.e. $p_1$) is relatively low.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique introduces $\\theta$, a threshold to <i>defer</i> the label assignment. If $max(P(t=c_i), 1-P(t=c_i)) < \\theta$ where $0.5 < \\theta < 1$, we defer the assignment at the moment, meaning we do not always assign the label with the highest probability. We refer to such region as <i> critical region </i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "For all the deferred assignment, we assign a label in a way that it mitigates the bias. For example, in our case, if the model is not sure (i.e. the condition for deffering the decision has been satisfied) for an AAE tweet, we do not assign \"Offensive\" even the probability of being \"Offensive\" is the highest. In the case where \"Offensive\" is the highest, we simply assign the label with second highest probability. For the deffered assignment for a SAE tweet, we assign \"Offensive\" regardless of the probabilities. By having different assignment methods for different groups, we can reduce the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical interpretation of the mitigation method is to give different costs when misprediction happens. For example, let's say our model predicted a label for an AAE tweet. If we have large $\\theta$ in this case, it means we are highly likely to defer the assignment. In other words, we are going to give the \"Offensive\" label to the AAE tweet only when we are very certain. Therefore, we can interpret it in a way that the cost of misprediction becomes high especially for the case where the ground truth was not \"Offensive\" but our prediction is \"Offensive\". Note that it is relatively okay to mispredict an AAE tweet with the ground truth \"Offensive\" because we need to reduce the number of \"Offensive\" judges to mitigate bias. These two different misprediction have different costs. More detailed mathematical formulation can be found in [this paper]().\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use $\\theta=0.52$ in this assignment. You may want to experiment different values of $\\theta$. Please go to the step 5-3. "
